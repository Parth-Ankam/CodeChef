You are given a grid with R rows (numbered 1 through R) and C columns (numbered 1 through C). A cell in row r and column c is denoted by (r,c). Two cells in the grid are adjacent
if they have a common side. For each valid i and j, there is a value ai,j written in cell ai,j.

A cell in the grid is stable if the number of cells in the grid which are adjacent to this cell is strictly greater than the value written in this cell. The whole grid is stable 
if all cells in the grid are stable.
