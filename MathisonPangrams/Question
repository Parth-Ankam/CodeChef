Mathison recently inherited an ancient papyrus that contained some text. Unfortunately, the text was not a PANGRAM. Now, Mathison has a particular liking for holoalphabetic 
strings and the text bothers him. The good news is that Mathison can buy letters from the local store in order to turn his text into a pangram.
