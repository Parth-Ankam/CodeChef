Chef is learning linear algebra. Recently, he learnt that for a square matrix M, trace(M) is defined as the sum of all elements on the main diagonal of M (an element lies on the 
main diagonal if its row index and column index are equal).

Now, Chef wants to solve some excercises related to this new quantity, so he wrote down a square matrix A with size N×N. A square submatrix of A with size l×l is a contiguous 
block of l×l elements of A. Formally, if B is a submatrix of A with size l×l, then there must be integers r and c (1≤r,c≤N+1−l) such that Bi,j=Ar+i−1,c+j−1 for each 1≤i,j≤l.

Help Chef find the maximum trace of a square submatrix of A.
